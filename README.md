# BusyCoq

Verified implementations of [Busy Beaver deciders][decider]. The computation
is split into two parts:

 - First, an untrusted decider, written in Rust, tries to decide whether
   each machine halts. When it succeeds, it generates a *certificate*.
 - Then, a *verifier*, proven correct in Coq and extracted to OCaml,
   checks each certificate and makes sure that it is correct.
   A Coq theorem guarantees that if the verifier accepts a certificate, then
   the corresponding machine doesn't halt.

## Implemented deciders

 - Cyclers
 - Translated Cyclers
 - Backwards Reasoning
 - Bouncers

## Individual machines

Apart from deciders, the repository includes manual proofs for some machines
considered hard to decide automatically. At the moment, these include:

 - [Skelet #1](https://www.sligocki.com/2023/03/13/skelet-1-infinite.html)
    (due to the nature of the proof, the final computation is done by an
    extracted OCaml program)
 - [Skelet #10](https://www.sligocki.com/2023/03/14/skelet-10.html)
 - [Skelet #15](https://www.sligocki.com/2023/02/05/shift-overflow.html)
 - Skelet #26 (proof contributed by Jason Yuen; I am not aware of
   the informal argument being outlined anywhere)
 - [Skelet #33](https://discuss.bbchallenge.org/t/skelet-33-doesnt-halt-coq-proof/180)
   (proof contributed by Jason Yuen)
 - [Skelet #34](https://www.sligocki.com/2023/02/02/skelet-34.html)
 - [Skelet #35](https://www.sligocki.com/2023/02/05/shift-overflow.html)
 - the five "cubic-finned" machines analyzed by Justin Blanchard
   (bbchallenge indices 7763480, 8120967, 10756090, 11017998, and 11018487).

## Running the deciders

Place the [seed database][seed] at `seed.dat` in the root of the repository.
Make sure you have Rust, Coq and OCaml installed. Then,

```bash
cd beaver
cargo build --release
time target/release/beaver decide ../seed.dat ../certs.dat
cd ../verify
make
time ./verify ../seed.dat ../certs.dat ../decided.dat
```

A binary file listing the database indices of all successfully decided machines
will be generated at `decided.dat`.
